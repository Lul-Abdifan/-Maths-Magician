      <p className="funny-history">
        Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a brilliant but
        eccentric mathematician named Dr. Calc. Dr. Calc was obsessed with
        creating the perfect calculator, one that could perform the most basic
        mathematical operation of all: addition. Dr. Calc believed that addition
        was the cornerstone of all mathematics, and that a calculator that could
        only add would be the most elegant and efficient tool for mathematicians
        and scientists alike. So, Dr. Calc poured all of his time, energy, and
        resources into creating the ultimate addition calculator. He
        experimented with different materials, circuit designs, and algorithms
        until he finally had a prototype that he was satisfied with. This
        calculator was a thing of beauty: sleek and shiny, with big, colorful
        buttons and a satisfyingly clicky keypad. But there was a catch: Dr.
        Calc's addition calculator was incredibly expensive. In fact, it was so
        expensive that only the wealthiest and most prestigious universities and
        research institutions could afford to buy one.

        The calculator was marketed as a "luxury item" for the intellectual
        elite, and it quickly became a status symbol for mathematicians and
        scientists around the world. Despite its exorbitant price tag, Dr.
        Calc's addition calculator became wildly popular. Mathematicians raved
        about its simplicity and elegance, and the scientific community hailed
        it as a groundbreaking invention. But there were also critics who mocked
        the calculator's limited functionality, and some even accused Dr. Calc
        of being a charlatan who had hoodwinked the academic world. But Dr. Calc
        didn't care. He was too busy basking in the glow of his own genius and
        counting his mountains of money. He spent his days lounging in his
        luxurious mansion, surrounded by his collection of rare books and exotic
        pets. And every now and then, he would chuckle to himself and think,
        "Who needs subtraction, multiplication, and division when you have the
        power of addition?"
